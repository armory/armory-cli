# ARMORY-CLI HAS MOVED. 

The new home of the Armory-CLI can be found in the [Armory-IO github organization](https://github.com/armory-io/armory-cli). 

If you use the [AVM (armory version manager) utility](https://github.com/armory/avm/releases/latest) to install and update the Armory CLI please update it to
version 1.1.0 or later to ensure you are getting the latest versions of the CLI going forward.
